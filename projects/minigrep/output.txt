With text:
I’m nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there’s a pair of us — don’t tell!
They’d banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

 - We found 'to' in line --> Are you nobody, too?

 - We found 'to' in line --> How dreary to be somebody!
